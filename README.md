# Hacktrick-Game-Reinforcement-Learning
The work in this repo done during a dell competition (Hacktrick 2022). the challenge was to build the best agent to play in the game.

## The game (Name__of the game)
the agents are responsible for building solar labs that consist of set of components (laptops, solar cell, projector ,container, constraction lab). the target to achieve the highest score
by building the optimal set of labs.
there are five types of labs:
- Lab_1: Components (1 Projector, 1 Solar Cell), Build time(10), Points(20)
- Lab_2: Components (1 Projector, 2 Solar Cells), Build time(15), Points(30)
- Lab_3: Components (2 Projectors, 2 Solar Cells), Build time(20), Points(40)
- Lab_4: Components (1 Projector, 1 Solar Cell, 1 Laptop), Build time(20), Points(40)
- Lab_5: Components (1 Projector, 2 Solar Cells, 2 Laptops), Build time(30), Points(70)
- 
| Lab | Components |Build time  | Points |
| ------------- | -------------  |------------- | ------------- |
| Lab_1 |1 Projector, 1 Solar Cell |10  | 20 |
| Lab_2 |1 Projector, 2 Solar Cells|15  | 30  |
| Lab_3 |2 Projectors, 2 Solar Cells |400  | 20 |
| Lab_4 |1 Projector, 1 Solar Cell, 1 Laptop|20  | 40  |
| Lab_5 |1 Projector, 2 Solar Cells, 2 Laptops |30  | 70 |
